## Bakery

A simple boilerplate for:
* CoffeeScript
* Backbone
* jQuery
* Jasmine and Sinon
* Less and Bootstrap

### Check it out!

* Open index.html to run the application.
* Open test.html to run the tests.

### Use it!

* Make sure you can access the coffee compiler from your command line directly
* Just run expresso.py and happily code everafter

It might not be the brightest solution but it works.

## Acknowledgments to
* Fernando Lujan, for the LESS/CSS integration.
